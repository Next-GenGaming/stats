## RUST Stats API

[![Rust Player Stats api](https://github.com/Next-GenGaming/stats/actions/workflows/node.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Next-GenGaming/stats/actions/workflows/node.yml)

This api is built to pull the data from the [PlayerRanks](https://codefling.com/plugins/player-ranks?page=7&tab=comments#comment-10100) plugin for codefling.

It pulls the data from the sql server and serves it up to be integrated into the future Next-Gen Gaming website.
